File: data_fetch.py

This program is designed to collect raw data used by our project. 

Data are collected from official website of dining services. This website provides 
information of only 3 dining halls, Commons, Sage and Barh. We will find other ways to 
collect information of Blitman dining hall.

This script aims to collect data for breakfast, lunch and dinner for each day.

One dining hall is a class object. 
One dining hall has three dictionaries. 
One dictionary represents one meal. The key of the dictionary is each serving window. The
value contains information of all dishes. 

This file will package data into json and save into database.
