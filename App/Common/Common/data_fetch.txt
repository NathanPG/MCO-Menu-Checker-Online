This program is designed to collect raw data used by our project. 

Data are collected from official website of dining services. This website provides 
information of only 3 dining halls, Commons, Sage and Barh. We will find other ways to 
collect information of Blitman dining hall.

This script aims to collect data for breakfast, lunch and dinner for each day.

One dining hall is represented by a dictionary. 
The key of the dictionary is the name of dish. The value is a list of string. The list 
has length of three and contains information of meal, course and cal corresponding to 
the current dish.

This file will package data into JSON and save into database.
